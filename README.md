# Good Eats
Good Eats is a Single Page Application that will showcase me learnig  React.JS.  The site will use the Yelp API to pull restaurants from certain areas that a user will filter.
This project will be the first of many React projects and other JS frameworks I would like to use.


# Initial REACT Steps
In order to start a React application, Node Package Manager will need to be installed.
Go To Node.JS website and download the installer for your system.
* https://nodejs.org/en/download
Then open up terminal of command prompt and run the command:
* node -v
* npm -v 
These commands will let you know what version of Node and NPM is installed on your system.
# Starting a React APP
To create a React APP, start by running the command:
* npx create-react-app my-app
This will start the process of building a React Application's libraries and dependencies.
Once successfully Installed, go to your terminal or command prompt and run the command:
* cd my-app
This will bring you into the directory of where your React App has been installed.  From here you are able to run the commands from Getting Started with Create React App listed directly below.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

# Authors
*  Christian Gawek - Initial Work


# Languages/Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS
* React.JS
* YELP API
* GIT


# Future Work
The future goals for Good Eats:
* Incorporating the Google Maps API to display the actual location of the restaurant when a user clicks on a restaurant
* Incorporating a backend the store user information into a Database.  This could be done using Node.JS
* Possibility of using Machine Learning for when a user logs in to display foods they might be interested in in a certain area.
